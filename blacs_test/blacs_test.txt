BLACS_PRB
  Process beginning.
  A sample program for the BLACS.
 
  In this simple example, we begin with a
  certain number of processes.
 
  These processes are arranged into a 2D
  computational grid (and any left over processes
  will exit.)
 
  Then BLACS is initialized, and the (0,0) process
  expects to receive a "check-in" message from all
  other active processes.
 
  The number of processes is            4
 
BLACS_PRB - Process      0
  Setting up the 2D process grid.
 
  prow_num =   2
  pcol_num =   2
 
BLACS_PRB - Process      0
  Calling BLACS_GRIDINIT to define the grid.
 
BLACS_PRB - Process      0
  Calling BLACS_GRIDINFO for process grid coordinates.
 
BLACS_PRB - Process      0
  Call BLACS_PNUM for process id from grid coordinates.
 
Process(0,0):
  All other processes must send me a check in message.
