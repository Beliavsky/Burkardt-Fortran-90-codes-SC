TEC_WRITE_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  A set of tests for TEC_WRITE.
 
TEST01
  Read my data file.
  Write a Tecplot file with 3D cylinder data.
 
  Number of copies of plane data =     17
 
  Create evenly spaced R and Z data.
 
  Writing the Tecplot file : cylinder_3d.tec
 
  Writing the Tecplot header.
 
  Read a set of data records for a sequence of times.
 
  Each data record is a (VR,VZ,VT) velocity field
  in the plane (R,Z,0).
 
  The routine TEC_WRITE_CYL_V writes NT copies of
  this data, so that TECPLOT will see a cylindically
  symmetric filled in version of the data.
 
  It also automatically converts the data from 
  (R,Z,T) and (VR,VZ,VT) format to
  (X,Y,Z) and (VX,VY,VZ) format.
  Handling data for time step =      1
  Handling data for time step =      2
 
  Number of time steps was      2
 
TEST02
  Read my data file.
  Write a Tecplot file with one plane of data.
  Create X and Y data.
  Writing the Tecplot file : plane_slice.tec
 
  Writing the Tecplot header.
 
  Begin reading sets of data.
  Writing data for time step =      1
  Writing data for time step =      2
 
  Number of time steps was      2
 
TEST03
  Read my data file.
  Write a Tecplot file with 3D cylinder data.
 
  Number of copies of plane data =      1
  Create R and H data.
  Writing the Tecplot file : cylinder_slice.tec
 
  Writing the Tecplot header.
 
  Begin reading sets of data.
  Writing data for time step =      1
  Writing data for time step =      2
 
  Number of time steps was      2
 
TEST04
  Assume we have PRUV data on a regular grid 
  of XY points.
  Do not assume any underlying finite element structure.
  Writing the Tecplot file : channel.tec
 
  Writing the Tecplot header.
 
TEST04
  The TECPLOT file has been written.
 
TEC_WRITE_PRB
  Normal end of execution.
