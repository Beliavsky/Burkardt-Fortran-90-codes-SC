    <P>
      We ran 
      <a href = "../cvt_size.html">cvt_size</a> on a problem with 10 generators, 
      of weights 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.  The results were not so good, but
      we think that's because we used only a few (10) points, and a
      wide range of weights, making the CVT regions irregular,
      with curved sides, with areas that are hard to control a priori.
