      <b>petsc_test</b> 
      FORTRAN90 programs which 
      demonstrates the use of the PETSc library.
    </p>

    <p>
      PETSc is a library of high level mathematical routines
      that can be executed in a parallel environment, making it
      easier for a user to gain the advantages of MPI.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> stands for the Portable Extensible Toolkit for 
      Scientific Computations.
    </p>

    <p>
      PETSc is particularly suitable for the numerical
      solution of systems of partial differential equations
      on high performance computers.  <b>PETSc</b> includes 
      parallel linear and nonlinear equation solvers and
      time integrators that may be used by application programs
      written in C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> consists of a number of libraries which work
      with a particular family of objects, such as vectors.
      Some of the <b>PETSc</b> modules deal with
      <ul>
        <li>
          index sets, including permutations;
        </li>
        <li>
          vectors;
        </li>
        <li>
          matrices, especially sparse matrices;
        </li>
        <li>
          distributed arrays, as when the data for a single matrix
          is distributed over a set of processors;
        </li>
        <li>
          Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems;
        </li>
        <li>
          preconditioners for linear algebra systems, including
          multigrid and sparse direct solvers;
        </li>
        <li>
          solvers for systems of nonlinear equations;
        </li>
        <li>
          partial differential equation solvers;
        </li>
        <li>
          timesteppers for solving time-dependent partial differential
          equations;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSc</b> includes parts of the following software libraries:
      <ul>
        <li>
          BLAS1 vector library,
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          BLAS3 matrix-matrix library,
        </li>
        <li>
          LAPACK linear algebra library,
        </li>
        <li>
          LIBTFS, an efficient parallel
          direct solver of Henry Tufo and Paul Fischer,
        </li>
        <li>
          LINPACK
          linear algebra library,
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "../minpack/minpack.html">MINPACK</a>
          minimization library,
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "../sparsekit/sparsekit.html">SPARSEKIT2</a>,
          Yousef Saad's sparse matrix library,
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "../sparsepak/sparsepak.html">SPARSEPAK</a>, matrix
          reordering routines.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PETSC</b> interacts with, complements, or supports a variety
      of programs including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "http://www.mathworks.com/matlab/">MATLAB</a>;
          <b>PETSC</b> can dump data in a format that <b>MATLAB</b> reads,
          or a running <b>PETSC</b> process can interact with a running
          <b>MATLAB</b> process, passing data back and forth "interactively".
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/c_src/metis/metis.html">METIS</a>;
          the <b>METIS</b> mesh partitioning program is designed to
          partition a mesh <i>before</i> a parallel process begins;
          <b>PETSC</b> provides an interface to a parallel version of
          <b>METIS</b>, called <b>PARMETIS</b>, which can partition the
          mesh <i>during</i> the parallel computation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      PETSc runs in parallel by relying on MPI, the message-passing 
    </p>

    <p>
      When PETSc is used by a FORTRAN90 program, each FORTRAN90
      routine must add one or more include statements, so that
      the constants and functions are properly declared.  Depending on
      the routines being used, there may be several include statements
      required.  However, if a FORTRAN90 routine uses any PETSc routine
      or constant, it is always necessary to have at least the
      following:
      <pre>
      #include "include/finclude/petsc.h"
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Before using PETSc, the user must set the environment
      variable <code>PETSC_DIR</code>, indicating the full path of the
      <b>PETSc</b> home directory.  On Phoenix, for instance, this might
      be done with the command
      <blockquote><code>
        setenv PETSC_DIR /usr/local/petsc
      </code></blockquote>
      This command might best be placed in the user's <code>.cshrc</code>
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before using PETSc, the user must set the environment
      variable <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>, indicating the architecture of the
      machine on which PETSc is to be run.  On Phoenix, for instance, 
      this might be done with the command
      <blockquote><code>
        setenv PETSC_ARCH linux-gnu
      </code></blockquote>
      This command might best be placed in the user's <code>.cshrc</code>
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The commands required to compile, link and load a program with
      PETSc are complicated.  It is best to use a makefile for
      this purpose, in which case most of the complications can be
      hidden.  A bare bones makefile for the example <i>ex1.c</i>,
      which is going to use PETSc's Krylov Subspace Package (KSP),
      would look like this:
      <pre>
include ${PETSC_DIR}/bmake/common/base

ex1: ex1.o
        -${FLINKER} -o ex1 ex1.o ${PETSC_FORTRAN_LIB} ${PETSC_LIB}
      </pre>
      To use this makefile, one simply types
      <blockquote><code>
        make ex1
      </code></blockquote>
      and the executable will be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>mpirun</b> command may be used for small jobs
      that run for a short time on a few processors.
      Repeated use of the <b>mpirun</b> command for large long jobs
      is an abuse of the system and will not be allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      To run a program that uses PETSc, the user may invoke the
      <b>mpirun</b> command, specifying the number of processors.
      <blockquote><code>
        mpirun -np 4 <i>ex1</i>
      </code></blockquote>
      The <b>mpirun</b> command will automatically log the user into
      3 more nodes of Phoenix, (requiring the user to type in a password
      each time!).
    </p>

    <p>
      To run a program that uses PETSc, the CONDOR system is
      preferable.  This is a batch system which tries to be fair
      and efficient in the allocation of computing resources.
      To use CONDOR, the user should create an executable program,
      then prepare a "CONDOR submit script" that describes how the
      executable is to be run, and on how many processors, and submit 
      the script.

      <b>MAKEFILE</b> contains the information necessary to properly
      compile, link and load the various user examples.  If you use
      <b>PETSc</b>, you will have to have a similar makefile.  The makefile
      is used by typing commands like
      <blockquote><code>
        make ex1
      </code></blockquote>
      which compiles, links and loads the program <i>ex1.F</i>, creating
      the executable <i>ex1</i>, which may then be run by submitting a

      even get the first stage of processing going, that is,
      I cannot pass it through the C preprocessor.  The symptom
      seems to be that the include files are not all in existence,
      are not in the right place, are misconfigured, and so on.
      I am giving up on the FORTRAN90 case, and retreating to
      C or C++, hoping for a better chance!
