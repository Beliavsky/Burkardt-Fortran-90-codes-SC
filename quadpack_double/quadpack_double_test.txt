  Integrand is log(x)/(1+100*x*x)
  Integral left endpoint A =      0.100000E-08
  Integral right endpoint B =    Infinity
  Exact integral is                22.4486    
  Estimated integral is            22.4486    
  Estimated integral error =      0.990524E-02
  Exact integral error =         -0.257637E-04
  Number of function evaluations, NEVAL =      885
  Error return code IER =        0
