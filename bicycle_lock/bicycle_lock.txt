  BICYCLE_LOCK seeks the combination of a bicycle lock.
  A bicycle combination lock consists of 3 dials,
  each having 10 symbols, 0 through 9.
  We seek to determine the combination C.
 
  The number of dials is M =    3
  The number of symbols is N =   10
  The number of possible combinations is M^N =     1000
  The "secret" combination is 445
 
  The combination was found on step      446
