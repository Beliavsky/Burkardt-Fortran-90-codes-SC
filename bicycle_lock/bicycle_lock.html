      BICYCLE_LOCK <br> The Bicycle Lock Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BICYCLE_LOCK</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      simulates the process of determining the combination of a bicycle lock,
      which is a 3 digit number between 000 and 999.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program demonstrates the method of exhaustive search, that is,
      it searches for an answer by trying every possibility.
