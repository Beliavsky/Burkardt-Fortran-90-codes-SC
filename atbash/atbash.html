      ATBASH <br> The Atbash Substitution Cipher
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ATBASH</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      applies the Atbash substitution cipher to a string of text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Atbash cipher replaces each character by its reverse element
      in the alphabet.  In particular 'A' becomes 'Z', 'B' becomes 'Y'
      and so on.  Case is respected.  Nonalphabetic characters are unchanged.
      The Atbash cipher is symmetric, so applying it to an enciphered
      string returns the original string.
