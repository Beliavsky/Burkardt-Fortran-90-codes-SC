      SLAB <br> Contour plots of optimization data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SLAB</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes contour plots of the an optimization function.
    </p>

    <p>
      The optimization function was defined as follows.  Given the
      value of a flow field along some sampling line, it was desired
      to determine the shape of an interior obstacle (a bump) which
      would result in a flow that would match the original data
      along the sampling line.  The shape of the bump could be described
      in terms of a few parameters (spline coefficients, really).
      The optimization function was the square root of the integral
      of the difference between the measured and computed flows along
      the sampling line.  It was desired to make plots of the 
      behavior of the optimization function as the shape parameters
      were varied.
      This data came from runs of the <b>FLOW3</b> and <b>FLOW4</b> programs.
