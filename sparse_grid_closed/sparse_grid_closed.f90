!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! ABSCISSA_LEVEL_CLOSED_ND: first level at which given abscissa is generated.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    We assume an underlying product grid.  In each dimension, this product
!    grid has order 2**LEVEL_MAX + 1.
!
!    We will say a sparse grid has total level LEVEL if each point in the
!    grid has a total level of LEVEL or less.
!
!    The "level" of a point is determined as the sum of the levels of the
!    point in each spatial dimension.
!
!    The level of a point in a single spatial dimension I is determined as
!    the level, between 0 and LEVEL_MAX, at which the point's I'th index
!    would have been generated.
!
!
!    This description is terse and perhaps unenlightening.  Keep in mind
!    that the product grid is the product of 1D grids,
!    that the 1D grids are built up by levels, having
!    orders (total number of points ) 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33 and so on,
!    and that these 1D grids are nested, so that each point in a 1D grid
!    has a first level at which it appears.
!
!    Our procedure for generating the points of a sparse grid, then, is
!    to choose a value LEVEL_MAX, to generate the full product grid,
!    but then only to keep those points on the full product grid whose
!    LEVEL is less than or equal to LEVEL_MAX.
!
!
!    Note that this routine is really just testing out the idea of
!    determining the level.  Our true desire is to be able to start
!    with a value LEVEL, and determine, in a straightforward manner,
!    all the points that are generated exactly at that level, or
!    all the points that are generated up to and including that level.
!
!    This allows us to generate the new points to be added to one sparse
!    grid to get the next, or to generate a particular sparse grid at once.

subroutine comp_next ( n, k, a, more, h, t )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! COMP_NEXT computes the compositions of the integer N into K parts.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    A composition of the integer N into K parts is an ordered sequence
!    of K nonnegative integers which sum to N.  The compositions (1,2,1)
!    and (1,1,2) are considered to be distinct.
!
!    The routine computes one composition on each call until there are no more.
!    For instance, one composition of 6 into 3 parts is
!    3+2+1, another would be 6+0+0.
!
!    On the first call to this routine, set MORE = FALSE.  The routine
!    will compute the first element in the sequence of compositions, and
!    return it, as well as setting MORE = TRUE.  If more compositions
!    are desired, call again, and again.  Each time, the routine will
!    return with a new composition.
!
!    However, when the LAST composition in the sequence is computed 
!    and returned, the routine will reset MORE to FALSE, signaling that
!    the end of the sequence has been reached.
!
!    This routine originally used a SAVE statement to maintain the
!    variables H and T.  I have decided that it is safer
!    to pass these variables as arguments, even though the user should
!    never alter them.  This allows this routine to safely shuffle
!    between several ongoing calculations.
!
!
!    There are 28 compositions of 6 into three parts.  This routine will
!    produce those compositions in the following order:
!
!     I         A
!     -     ---------
!     1     6   0   0

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! LEVEL_TO_ORDER_CLOSED converts a level to an order for closed rules.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Sparse grids can naturally be nested.  A natural scheme is to use
!    a series of one-dimensional rules arranged in a series of "levels"
!    whose order roughly doubles with each step.
!
!    The arrangement described here works naturally for the Clenshaw Curtis
!    and Newton Cotes closed rules.  
!
!    The idea is that we start with LEVEL = 0, ORDER = 1 indicating the single 
!    point at the center, and for all values afterwards, we use the 
!    relationship
!
!      ORDER = 2**LEVEL + 1
!
!    The following table shows how the growth will occur:
!
!    Level    Order
!
!    0          1
!    1          3 =  2 + 1
!    2          5 =  4 + 1
!    3          9 =  8 + 1
!    4         17 = 16 + 1
!    5         33 = 32 + 1
!
!    For the Clenshaw Curtis and Newton Cotes Closed rules, the point growth
!    is nested.  If we have ORDER points on a particular LEVEL, the next
!    level includes all these old points, plus ORDER-1 new points, formed
!    in the gaps between successive pairs of old points.
!
!    Level    Order = New + Old
!
!    0          1   =  1  +  0
!    1          3   =  2  +  1
!    2          5   =  2  +  3
!    3          9   =  4  +  5
!    4         17   =  8  +  9
!    5         33   = 16  + 17
!
!    In this routine, we assume that a vector of levels is given,
!    and the corresponding orders are desired.

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! VEC_COLEX_NEXT2 generates vectors in colex order.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The vectors are produced in colexical order, starting with
!
!    (0,        0,        ...,0),
!    (1,        0,        ...,0),
!     ...
!    (BASE(1)-1,0,        ...,0)
!
!    (0,        1,        ...,0)
!    (1,        1,        ...,0)
!    ...
!    (BASE(1)-1,1,        ...,0)
!
!    (0,        2,        ...,0)
!    (1,        2,        ...,0)
!    ...
!    (BASE(1)-1,BASE(2)-1,...,BASE(DIM_NUM)-1).
!
!  Examples:
!
!    DIM_NUM = 2,
!    BASE = ( 3, 3 )
!
!    0   0
!    1   0
!    2   0
!    0   1
!    1   1
!    2   1
!    0   2
!    1   2
!    2   2

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) BASE(DIM_NUM), the bases to be used in each 
!    dimension.  In dimension I, entries will range from 0 to BASE(I)-1.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) A(DIM_NUM).  On each return, A
!    will contain entries in the range 0 to N-1.
!
!    Input/output, logical MORE.  Set this variable FALSE before
!    the first call.  On return, MORE is TRUE if another vector has
!    been computed.  If MORE is returned FALSE, ignore the output 
!    vector and stop calling the routine.
