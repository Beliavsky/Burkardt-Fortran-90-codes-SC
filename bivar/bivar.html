      BIVAR <br> Bivariate interpolation of scattered data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BIVAR</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      interpolates scattered bivariate data,
      by Hiroshi Akima.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>BIVAR</b> accepts a set of (X,Y) data points scattered in 2D,
      with associated Z data values, and is able to construct a smooth
      interpolation function Z(X,Y), which agrees with the given data,
      and can be evaluated at other points in the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>BIVAR</b> is a FORTRAN90 version of ACM TOMS Algorithm 526.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original, true, correct version of ACM TOMS 526 is available
      in the TOMS subdirectory of
      <a href="http://www.netlib.org/">the NETLIB web site</a>.
