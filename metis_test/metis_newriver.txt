METIS_TEST
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the METIS library for graph partitioning.

PARTGRAPHKWAY_TEST:
  METIS_PartGraphKway partitions a graph into K parts
  using multilevel K-way partition.

  Return code =    1
  Edge cuts for partition =    3

  Partition vector:

  Node  Part

     1     1
     2     1
     3     0
     4     1
     5     0
     6     0

PARTGRAPHRECURSIVE_TEST:
  METIS_PartGraphRecursive partitions a graph into K parts
  using multilevel recursive bisection.

  Return code =    1
  Edge cuts for partition =    3

  Partition vector:

  Node  Part

     1     1
     2     0
     3     0
     4     1
     5     1
     6     0
